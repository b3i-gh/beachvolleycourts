# beach volley courts booking system

This app is used to book and manage the availability of public beach volleyball courts. It is envisioned to include a user identity system that allows users to view court availability, book a court for one or more hours, schedule or make payments, cancel reservations, and potentially purchase merchandise or request/renew association membership.

Administrators will have the ability to confirm reservation requests, validate completed payments, and insert course schedules that occupy the courts.
